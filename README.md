### Activating the development environment

This project uses [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) to manage development environments. To get started, you need to install Devbox and activate the environment for this project. The main benefit of using Devbox is that it allows you to run the project in a consistent environment without needing to install all dependencies on your local machine.

```shell
devbox shell
```

When you're done with your work, you can deactivate the environment, and Devbox will clean up all the packages and tools that were installed so that you won't have to worry about cluttering your system.

```shell
exit
```

### Building the website

```shell
task build
```
